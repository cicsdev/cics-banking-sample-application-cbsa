# The CICS Bank Sample Application(CBSA) base/COBOL BMS User Guide

##

## What is the CICS Bank Sample Application?

> The CICS Bank Sample Application (CBSA) is a CICS/COBOL based
> application utilising banking functionality that will be used, in
> branch, by a Bank Teller/Clerk. This includes the ability to create a
> new customer, open accounts, pay money in, withdraw money, transfer
> funds between accounts etc. etc.
>
> The application has a set of BMS screens and comes fully populated
> with data i.e. existing accounts and customers.

## CICS Bank Sample Application Architecture:

> Please refer to the GitHub repo:
> cicsdev/cics-banking-sample-application-cbsa/doc for architecture
> information.

## Scenarios:

> The CBSA application has a number of practical usage scenarios, here
> are just a few examples:

-   As an easy to use, out of the box, application. Which comes pre
    populated with data.

-   CBSA can be used as a teaching/learning aid, as it goes beyond a
    simple CICS coding sample.

-   The full CBSA application demonstrates how various technologies can
    be integrated together; CICS, COBOL, BMS, Db2, SQL, Java, Liberty,
    Spring Boot etc.

-   CBSA is an example of a traditionally written application, which has
    been extended over time. It is structured in a way that most
    existing CICS TS customers will recognise and can be a conversation piece
    when discussing the application development lifecycle.

-   CBSA can be used as the building blocks for application
    modernisation conversations.

-   CBSA can be used as an application for testing purposes. For
    example: the testing of CICS interactions, or
    verification/validation/interaction of IBM and vendor tool
    offerings.

## Accessing the CBSA application:

> After completion of the installation instructions for CBSA base/COBOL,
> the BMS application may be invoked from within the CICS TS region, by
> utilising the OMEN transaction:
>
> ![BMSUser OMEN](../doc/images/BMSUserGuide/BMSUser_OMEN.jpg)
>
>
>
> This should display the CBSA main menu:
>
> ![BMSUser Main menu](../doc/images/BMSUserGuide/BMSUser_Main_Menu.jpg)
>

## Navigating CBSA:

> CICS Bank Sample Application is driven from the main menu. Simply
> select the number or letter for the function that you require.
>
> ![BMSUser OMEN](../doc/images/BMSUserGuide/BMSUser_Main_Menu.jpg)
>

#### Displaying Customer information (option 1 from the main menu):

####

> The Bank has a number of prepopulated Customers set up during
> installation. To display the information for a customer, select option
> 1:
>
> ![BMSUser option 1 start](../doc/images/BMSUserGuide/BMSUser_Opt_1_START.jpg)
>
>
> This gives:
>
> ![BMSUser option 1 empty](../doc/images/BMSUserGuide/BMSUser_Opt_1_EMPTY.jpg)
>
> and then enter a customer number e.g. 1234:
>
> ![BMSUser option 1 entry](../doc/images/BMSUserGuide/BMSUser_Opt_1_ENTRY.jpg)
>
>
> And the details for that customer will be returned:
>
> ![BMSUser option 1 success](../doc/images/BMSUserGuide/BMSUser_Opt_1_SUCCESS.jpg)
>
>
> Notice further options are displayed at the bottom of the screen. In
> this case, how to exit the screen (f3), how to Update the Customer
> details (f10) or how to Delete the Customer (f5).

#### Displaying Account information (option 2 from the main menu):

####

> There are lots of prepopulated accounts belonging to customers. To
> display details of a single account, select option 2 (from the main
> menu):
>
> ![BMSUser option 2 start](../doc/images/BMSUserGuide/BMSUser_Opt_2_START.jpg)
>
>
> This gives:
>
> ![BMSUser option 2 empty](../doc/images/BMSUserGuide/BMSUser_Opt_2_EMPTY.jpg)
>
> and then enter an account number:
>
> ![BMSUser option 2 entry](../doc/images/BMSUserGuide/BMSUser_Opt_2_ENTRY.jpg)
>
>
> This returns:
>
> ![BMSUser option 2 success](../doc/images/BMSUserGuide/BMSUser_Opt_2_SUCCESS.jpg)
>
>
> As before, further options are displayed at the bottom of the screen.

#### Displaying All of the Accounts for a given Customer (option A from the main menu):

####

> To see what accounts a particular Customer has select option A from
> the main menu:
>
> ![BMSUser option A start](../doc/images/BMSUserGuide/BMSUser_Opt_A_START.jpg)
>
> and provide the Customer number:
>
> ![BMSUser option A entry](../doc/images/BMSUserGuide/BMSUser_Opt_A_ENTRY.jpg)
>
>
> ![BMSUser option A success](../doc/images/BMSUserGuide/BMSUser_Opt_A_SUCCESS.jpg)
>
>
> In this example Customer 3 has 3 accounts (ISA, SAVING, CURRENT) which
> all hold different balances.

##

#### Creating a New Customer (option 3 from the main menu):

####

> To create a new Customer, select option 3 from the main menu:
>

>
> ![BMSUser option 3 empty](../doc/images/BMSUserGuide/BMSUser_Opt_3_EMPTY.jpg)
>
> Then supply the required information:
>
> ![BMSUser option 3 entry](../doc/images/BMSUserGuide/BMSUser_Opt_3_ENTRY.jpg)
>
>
> Validation will guide you through what content is acceptable or not,
> on a field-by-field basis.
>
> Once the information provided has passed the validation check a new
> Customer Number, Sort Code and Credit Score will be returned.

#### Creating a New Account (option 4 from the main menu):

>
>
> Assign a Customer Number that the new Account relates to, an Account
> Type which can be MORTGAGE, SAVINGS, ISA, LOAN or CURRENT. Enter an
> interest rate that is applicable to that account, and any overdraft
> amount applicable to that account (in whole pounds) and hit enter.
>
> The details get validated, with suitable messages returned if a field
> needs to be modified. In the example below, the Account Type has not
> been supplied, resulting in an appropriate error message:
>
> ![BMSUser option 4 error](../doc/images/BMSUserGuide/BMSUser_Opt_4_ERROR.jpg)
>
>

All successfully enacted transactions are updated in real time, and
details of all successful transactions (apart from Account and Customer
inquiries) are recorded on the PROCTRAN table (PROCTRAN=Details of
successfully processed transactions).
